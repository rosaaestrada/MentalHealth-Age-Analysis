# Summary Statistics

## Pearson's Chi-square
**Age and Veteran Status:** p-value = 2.25e-227
- The statistics and expected frequencies indicate that there is a significant relationship between age and veteran status.

**Age and General Health:** p-value = 0.0
- A significant relationship exists between age group and general health, suggesting age plays a role in general health status.

**Age and Education:** p-value = 3.24e-23
- There is a statistically significant relationship between age group and education level, indicating age influences education.

**Mental Health and Veteran Status:** p-value = 9.31e-14
- A significant relationship is found between mental health and veteran status.

**Mental Health and Age:** p-value = 5.32e-157
- There is a significant relationship between mental health and age.
- Suggesting that different age groups experience varying levels of mental health, with some age groups more prone to "no good" mental health days than others.

**Mental Health and General Health:** p-value = 0.0
- The relationship between mental health and general health is significant.

**Mental Health and Education:** p-value = 5.21e-122
- There is a significant relationship between mental health and education.

## Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)
- The ANOVA results indicate no significant differences across the different variables (Veteran, Age_Group, GeneralHealth, and Education) with respect to MentalHealth (all p-values > 0.05).
- This suggests that none of the individual factors considered in the analysis (Veteran, Age_Group, GeneralHealth, and Education) have a significant impact on mental health days when considered independently.

**Possible Explanations:**
- This could be because mental health is a complex and multifaceted issue, possibly influenced by the interplay of multiple factors rather than any single one. There could be other factors not considered in this analysis that may have a stronger impact.
- The effects of the variables might be intertwined, such that their combined impact on mental health is more significant than their individual contributions. This could lead to a lack of clear differences across individual variables.
- The sample size and distribution across the different categories may not have been large enough to detect small differences in mental health outcomes across the different groups.

## Correlation Matrix between MentalHealth and the independent variables
**Age_Group_55 and MentalHealth (0.11):**
- Shows a moderate correlation, suggesting that individuals in the age group 55 and older may have a slightly higher likelihood of experiencing "no good" mental health days.

**Age_Group_18_to_34 and MentalHealth (0.08):** 
- Shows a weaker correlation, suggesting that younger individuals in this age group may also experience some "no good" mental health days, but not as significantly as the older age group.

**GeneralHealth_Poor and MentalHealth (0.36):** 
- Indicates a strong positive relationship between individuals who report "poor" general health and the frequency of "no good" mental health days.
- This correlation suggests that individuals with poor general health are more likely to experience more frequent "no good" mental health days.

**GeneralHealth_Excellent and MentalHealth (0.27):** 
- Suggests that individuals who report excellent general health are less likely to experience "no good" mental health days. However, the correlation is not as strong as for those with poor general health.

**Education_College and MentalHealth (0.10) and Education_High_School and MentalHealth (0.09):** 
- Suggests a slight association between education level and mental health days, with lower levels of education not potentially linked to more "no good" mental health days.

**Veteran_No and Veteran_Yes with MentalHealth (0.03):** 
- Both show very weak correlations with MentalHealth. This suggests that veteran status does not have a strong impact on the likelihood of experiencing "no good" mental health days.
