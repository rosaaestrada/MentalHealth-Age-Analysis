## Purpose
In this project I analyzed the relationship between mental health and age in adults between the ages of 18 and 99 in the United States using Pearson's Chi-square, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), and Correlation Matrix.

## Methodology

This project employs a structured methodology consisting of (Data cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and feature engineering). Following those steps, statistical analysis is conducted utilizing Pearson's Chi-Square, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), and Correlation Matrix. 

## Statistical Research
- 1 in 5 adults have a mental health condition; that is more than the population of New York and Florida combined, making up more than 40 million Americans (Mental Health America, 2023).
- In 2018, 19% of adults experienced a mental health illness (Terlizzi & Zablotsky, 2020).
- In 2019, 20% of adults were living with a mental health illness, and in 2020, the percentage increased to 40% (The Blackberry Center, 2020).
- The National Alliance on Mental Health Illness found that 50% of all lifetime mental illnesses begin at the age of 14, and 75% begin at the age of 24 (2023).
