# Final Evaluation

## ðŸŸ£ Research Question:
What ages experience the most "no good" mental health days?
- Individuals in the age group 55+ experience the most "no good" mental health days, as they have a moderately stronger positive correlation (0.11) with poor mental health days compared to the age group 18-34 with a weaker correlation (0.08).
- Indicating that while younger individuals may experience some "no good" mental health days, the impact is not as significant as it is for older individuals.
- Additionally, the relationship between age and general health may further impact mental health outcomes.
- ðŸŸ¢ Overall, age appears to be a critical factor in experiencing "no good" mental health days, particularly in age groups 55+ and 18-34. General health also plays a role in the number of "no good" mental health days across different age groups.

## Statistical Research Correlations
- The National Alliance on Mental Health Illness found that 50% of all lifetime mental illnesses begin at the age of 14 and 75% begin at the age of 24 (2023).
- These statistics suggest that mental health issues often begin at a young age, which aligns with the findings in this project that the age group 18-34 experiences a high likelihood of "no good" mental health days. It emphasizes the importance of early intervention and targeted support for younger individuals.

## Overall Takeaway
- Understanding that mental health issues often begin in adolescence or early adulthood and can worsen in older age groups can help guide targeted interventions for these vulnerable populations. The increasing rate of mental health issues in recent years highlights the need for ongoing research and action to address underlying causes and provide adequate care and support.
- The correlation data suggests older individuals (55+) are more likely to experience "no good" mental health days, while younger individuals (18-34) also experience some negative mental health days. This aligns with The National Alliance on Mental Health Illness's findings regarding the onset of mental health issues beginning at a young age.

## Future Directions
- Future research could explore the interaction effects between different variables, such as examining how combinations of age, education, general health, and veteran status impact mental health.
- Consider expanding the data collection to include additional factors such as income, employment status, or access to healthcare, which might influence mental health outcomes.
